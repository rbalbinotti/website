## About Me
I've always had a relationship I am not familiar with computers, but as a software user. I find the creativity of software developers incredible, although I have never had any interest in becoming one myself.

When I first came into contact with AI and ML on an image recognition website, I realized that this would be the perfect profession for me. I love being in a constant state of learning, which is ideal for a data scientist and analyst.

My journey in technology involves discovering patterns, transforming data into strategic decisions, creating models, and offering direct and effective solutions to complex problems.

Currently living in Porto Alegre/ RS-Brazil, always looking for new inspirations.

### Postgraduate
- **Computer Vision** – [Data Science Academy](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/) (October/2024 – Present)

## My Projects

### [Cancer Prediction through Mutations Genetics](https://github.com/rbalbinotti/treat_cancer_keras)
- **Challenge**: Treat clinical texts to predict 9 classes, without using paid architectures, training data contains more than 3 thousand observations, with padding of 49680.
- **Action**: I used a pre-trained model (DistilBertClassifier), created an LSTM network, encoding technique, tokenization, tuning with Keras RandomSearch, class balancing and GPU training. 
- **Tools**: Keras_NLP, keras RandomSearch, TensorFlow, Spacy, Scikit-Learn, python, PCA
- **Result**: Classification model with Keras-NLP using the pre-trained DistilBertClassifier model proved to be the most suitable for improvement.

### [Hospital Data Analysis](https://github.com/rbalbinotti/analise_hospitalar_R)
- **Challenge**: Answer business questions using collected data.
- **Action**: I used exploratory analysis techniques and linear regression models and statistical testing.
- **Tools**: sqldf, tidyverse
- **Result**: 3 most relevant variables identified to explain and predict hospitalization costs.

### [London Bus Safety Analysis](https://github.com/rbalbinotti/Analise_Risco_Transp_Publico)
- **Challenge**: Identify characteristics of people and places most likely to be involved in bus accidents.
- **Action**: I developed a [website](https://londonbusanalysis.streamlit.app/) with StreamLit where analyses are made with the collected data.
- **Tools**: Pandas, StreamLit, Vega-Altair, Seaborn
- **Result**: By interpreting the graphs, we can identify points of attention for campaigns to reduce accidents involving public transport.

### [ETL and Data Analysis Events House](https://github.com/rbalbinotti/thai_portfolio)
- **Challenge**: Collect and organize data from various sources without standardization. Make the business area understand the importance of making data-driven decisions. 
- **Action**: Data was collected and processed using Python language and presentation created with PowerBI.
- **Tools**: Pandas, Plotly, PowerBI
- **Result**: [Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/links/W_23bQhW44?ctid=95b5599e-390a-4a3f-89b3-994aea1ad632&pbi_source=linkShare) that concentrated the data in just one place, organizing it and enabling an accurate view of the business guidelines. Insights for business improvement and expansion. 

### [Predicting Energy Consumption of Electric Cars](https://github.com/rbalbinotti/Prevendo_Cons_Energia_Carros)
- **Challenge**: Data with many missing values, many variables needing to be treated and standardized. 
- **Action**: I used missing value treatment techniques and research on vehicle characteristics to fill in the data, created linear regression models for variable selection and training, as well as a Random Forest model for training.
- **Tools**: Naniar, visdat, C50, caret, tidyverse
- **Result**: Trained model capable of predicting energy consumption in electric cars.

## Skills
- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL , Julia
- **Tools**: Jupyterlab, Tableau, PowerBI, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Hadoop, Spark, Docker
- **Methods**: Supervised (SVM, Linear, Ensembles, Naive Bayes) and Unsupervised (Mean shift , K-means, DBSCAN), Dimensionality reduction (PCA).
