## About Me

I've always had a close relationship with computers, but mainly as a software user. I find the creativity of software creators incredible, although I've never been interested in becoming one.

When I first encountered AI and ML through an image recognition site, I realized that this would be the perfect profession for me. I love being in a constant state of learning, which is ideal for a data scientist and analyst.

My journey in technology involves discovering patterns, transforming data into strategic decisions, creating models, and providing direct and effective solutions to complex problems.

## My Projects

### [Cancer Prediction Through Genetic Mutations](https://github.com/rbalbinotti/treat_cancer_keras)
- **Challenge**: Process clinical texts to predict 9 classes without using paid architectures, training data contains over 3k observations with padding of 49,680.
- **Action**: Used a pre-trained model (distilbert), created an LSTM network, applied encoding techniques, tokenization, tuning with Keras RandomSearch, class balancing, and GPU training.
- **Tools**: keras_NLP, Keras RandomSearch, TensorFlow, spaCy, scikit-learn, Python, PCA
- **Result**: Classification model with an accuracy of **PLACEHOLDER FOR ACCURACY**

### [Hospital Data Analysis](https://github.com/rbalbinotti/analise_hospitalar_R)
- **Challenge**: Answer business questions using collected data.
- **Action**: Used exploratory analysis techniques, linear regression models, and statistical testing.
- **Tools**: sqldf, tidyverse
- **Result**: Identified 3 most relevant variables to explain and predict hospital admission costs.

### [London Bus Safety Analysis](https://github.com/rbalbinotti/Analise_Risco_Transp_Publico)
- **Challenge**: Identify characteristics of people and locations more likely to be involved in bus accidents.
- **Action**: Developed a [site](https://londonbusanalysis.streamlit.app/) with Streamlit to analyze collected data.
- **Tools**: Pandas, Streamlit, Vega-Altair, Seaborn
- **Result**: Graphical interpretations helped identify key points for public transport accident reduction campaigns.

### [ETL and Data Analysis for Event House](https://github.com/rbalbinotti/thai_portfolio)
- **Challenge**: Collect and organize data from varied, unstandardized sources. Make the business area understand the importance of data-driven decisions.
- **Action**: Collected and processed data using Python, created a presentation with PowerBI.
- **Tools**: Pandas, Plotly, PowerBI
- **Result**: [Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/links/W_23bQhW44?ctid=95b5599e-390a-4a3f-89b3-994aea1ad632&pbi_source=linkShare) that centralizes data in one place, providing precise business insights and growth opportunities.

### [Predicting Energy Consumption in Electric Cars](https://github.com/rbalbinotti/Prevendo_Cons_Energia_Carros)
- **Challenge**: Data with many missing values, many variables needing treatment and standardization.
- **Action**: Applied techniques for handling missing values and researched vehicle characteristics for data completion, created linear regression models for variable selection and training, as well as a Random Forest model for training.
- **Tools**: Naniar, visdat, C50, caret, tidyverse
- **Result**: Trained model capable of predicting energy consumption in electric cars.
